# Auto Watermark & Resize Tool

Windows desktop app for batch watermarking images with selectable output size mode: resize to 1280px width or keep original dimensions.

## Features

- Select a transparent PNG logo file.
- Select either a single image or a folder containing `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` images.
- Choose output mode between `Resize 1280px` and `Original Size`.
- In `Resize 1280px` mode, resize every image to 1280px width while preserving aspect ratio.
- In `Original Size` mode, keep the source dimensions and only apply the watermark.
- Apply different default watermark positions for landscape and portrait images.
- Adjust watermark size plus horizontal and vertical offsets from the UI.
- Preview the logo, the selected source image, and the final output before processing.
- In `folder` mode, review images in a built-in gallery and switch between them before exporting.
- Save different logo position, size, and output-mode settings for each image in the selected folder.
- Drag the logo directly on the `Result` preview to change position.
- Use the mouse wheel over the logo on the `Result` preview to resize it.
- Save output into a sibling folder named `[OriginalFolder]_Processed` without overwriting source files.
- Show progress and keep the UI responsive during batch processing.
